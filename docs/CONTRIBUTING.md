# How to contribute to NumaHOP.

## Did you find a bug ?

> Do not open an issue if the bug is a security vulnerability in our
> dependencies. We have automatic dependencies report provided by github in the
> security tab. But if the vulnerability is in the NumaHOP code itself please
> do

Before submitting a bug report ensure the bug was not already reported by
searching the [issues][issues]. If you
find an issue that describe the same bug, you can add a comment describing your
situation and add more context information.

If your unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new
one][new_issue]. Be sure to include a clear **title** with as much relevant
information as possible. For example `Creation of duplicate document units
while importing csv notices.` is good descriptive title while `Import didn't
work as expected` is too vague. The more information you provide the greater
the likelihood of the bug being fixed is.

The bug report form should ask you the following information:
- A description of what you wanted to do and/or expected to happen:
- A description of what happened with potential error messages (from the
front-end) or screen shots.
- Steps to reproduce: A list of steps that allows you to see the bug in action.
- Browser used: Useful to know which browser was used to access NumaHOP.

### Issue life cycle. 

Just after the bug report was created the issue has the label `Triage` which
means that it was not reviewed by a developer and needs to be evaluated. Once
the issue was reviewed if the bug report is too vague it will be labeled as
`Needs more info`. If we can't reproduce the bug in any shape or form it will
be marked as `Won't fix`. If the bug is easy to fix and relatively straight
forward it will receive the `Good first issue`. These are good issues to tackle
for new contributors. If a contributor managed to reproduce your bug the report
will receive the `Reproduced` label and your bug is eligible to a patch. Then a
contributor might develop a patch resolving your bug and make a pull request
for it mentioning the bug report issue number. Finally when the issue is merged
it will receive the `Fixed` label and the issue will be closed.

## Are you writing a patch ?

- Fork the repository and create a new branch with a descriptive name for the
patch you plan on submitting.
- Develop your patch following the coding guidelines.
- Add a note about your contribution to the changelog in the appropriate
category. This is not required but appreciated.
- Open a new pull request with the patch.
- Ensure the PR description clearly describes your solution to the problem you
fixed. Include the issue number if applicable.
- Before submitting for review please ensure the content of the PR conforms to
the coding guidelines and make sure the `make checks` command succeeds when
applicable.

### Commits & Commit messages

> General rule: separate formatting and adapting to coding guidelines from the
contribution itself. 

If the part of the code you are modifying needs re-formatting, do the
formatting in a separate commit. If the part of the code you are modifying does
not follow the coding guidelines, try to adapt the code to follow those in a
separate commit (not always possible). Then, add the commit with the fix
itself. This facilitate the reviewing of the merge request a lot.

In the commit message where the fix is situated please include a test plan for
the fix. This makes the review process a lot quicker and easier for the
reviewer.

# Coding guidelines

## Coding guideline violations

If you find coding guidelines violations in the source code you can submit an
issue with the tag: `Coding Guidelines violation`. These issues are not urgent
and will not be included in the milestones. However these are often labeled as
`Good first issue` and are great to get familiar with the codebase.

## Java

### (JAVA 1) Prefer `Optional` over  `null`.

`null` is error prone and unclear. When seeing the signature of a function it
is not immediately clear if the result can be `null` for this reason prefer the
use of `Optional` when possible. If not possible please annotate the argument
or parameter with the `@Nullable` annotation.

### (JAVA 2) Code Comments

Each java method in a class should be documented using javadoc comments `\**
*\` at the exception of the API handlers these should be commented using the
swagger annotations.

Trivial getters and setters can be left undocumented.

### (JAVA 3) `return` statement in `forEach` lambda function should be avoided

The `return` statement in `forEach` lambda function has the same effect as a
`continue` in a classic for loop. In long lambda functions this can become
confusing. In this case a classic for loop is preferred. If it make sense the
lambda can also be extracted to a named function.

Here is an example:
```java
iterable_collection.forEach(element -> {
    if (!isValid(element)) {
        rapportError();
        return;
    }

    if (!canTaskBePerformed(element)) {
        rapportOtherError();
        return;
    }
    
    performTask(element)
});

```
Instead prefer:
```java
for (Element element : iterable_collection) {
    if (!isValid(element)) {
        rapportError();
        continue;
    }

    if (!canTaskBePerformed(element)) {
        rapportOtherError();
        continue;
    }
    
    performTask(element)
}
```

Or:
```java
private void checkAndPerformTask(Element element) {
    if (!isValid(element)) {
        rapportError();
        return;
    }

    if (!canTaskBePerformed(element)) {
        rapportOtherError();
        return;
    }
    
    performTask(element)
}

iterable_collection.forEach(checkAndPerformTask);
```


## Front-End
### (Front-End 1) Code Comments

In JavaScript files that defines any new angular module, use this kind of
comment:
```js
/**
 * @memberOf NumaHOP
 * @class NumaHOP.MyModule
 */
```

For each AngularJs service, controller, filter or directive, use the following
comment replacing service by any of the previously mentioned item:

```js
/**
 * @memberOf NumaHOP.MyModule
 * @ngdoc service
 * @name MyService
 * @ngInject //Document the injected angular js services.
 * @description This is my angularjs service.
 */
 function myService(/* ... */) {
    /* ... */
 }
 angular.module('NumaHOP.MyModule').service('myService', myService);
```

Similarly for a controller use:
```js
/**
 * @memberOf NumaHOP.MyModule
 * @ngdoc controller 
 * @name myController
 * @ngInject //Document the injected angular js services.
 * @description This is my angularjs controller.
 */
 function myController(/* ... */) {
    /* ... */
 }
 angular.module('NumaHOP.MyModule').controller('myController', myController);
```

To document a function or a property:
```js
/**
 * @property a
 */
var obj = {};

/**
 * @memberOf NumaHOP.MyModule.My{Controller/Service/Directive}
 * @func myFunction
 * @description This is my angularjs service.
 * @param a
 */
function myFunction(a) {
    /* ... */
}
```

## Api

### (API 1) Specification

The API of NumaHOP must respect the [Open-Api v3.1 specification][oas_spec].

### (API 2) Api design

### (API 2.1) HTTP Methods

Where applicable CRUD methods must used: 
| functionality | url             | method | 
| ------------- | --------------- | ------ |
| create        | `/<object>`     | POST   |
| read          | `/<object>/:id` | GET    |
| update        | `/<object>/:id` | PUT    |
| delete        | `/<object>/:id` | DELETE |
| list          | `/<object>`     | GET    |

If an object is often updated partialy in a namable way a `PATCH` method
can be implementd.

### (API 2.2) Unique routes for functionality 

One route should be associated with only one functionality.

Disallowed:
| functionality                  | url                  | method | 
| ------------------------------ | -------------------- | ------ |
| check if operation is finished | `/operation?isDone`  | GET    |
| process operation              | `/operation?process` | GET    |

Allowed:
| functionality                  | url                  | method | 
| ------------------------------ | -------------------- | ------ |
| check if operation is finished | `/operation/isDone`  | GET    |
| process operation              | `/operation/process` | POST   |

### (API 3) Api implementation

##### (API 3.1) Use of verbose annotation

On handlers prefer the use of the methods mapping (eg: `@GetMapping`,
`@PostMappin`, etc) instead of the more verbose `@RequestMapping`.

#### (API 3.3) Route request Handlers and Controller classes

Minimize the number of controllers and route handlers per controllers. The
general rule is if a route has the 4 CRUD methods defined it should have its
own class:
- POST (Creation)
- GET (Reading)
- PUT (Update)
- DELETE (Deletion)

Disallowed:
```java
@RequestMapping("/api/rest/user")
class UserController {
    
    /* ... other /api/rest/user handlers  */

    @GetMapping("/{id}/profile")
    public ResponseEntity<?> getUserProfile() { /* ... */ }

    @PostMapping("/{id}/profile")
    public ResponseEntity<?> createUserProfile() { /* ... */ }

    @DeleteMapping("/{id}/profile")
    public ResponseEntity<?> deleteUserProfile() { /* ... */ }

    @PutMapping("/{id}/profile")
    public ResponseEntity<?> updateUserProfile() { /* ... */ }
}
```
Instead a `UserProfileController` class should be created.

Allowed:
```java
@RequestMapping("/api/rest/user")
class UserController {

    /* ... other /api/rest/user handlers */

    @GetMapping("/search")
    public ResponseEntity<?> searchUsers() { /* ... */ }
}
```

Similarly if a Controller doesn't have the 4 CRUD methods it should be merged
with a parent controller if possible.

#### (API 3.4) Handler return values

All the response values of the handlers must return DTO class if the media type
is JSON.

Disallowed:
```java
@RequestMapping("/api/rest/user")
class UserController {

    /* ... /api/rest/user handlers */

    @GetMapping("/user/{id}", produces = MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_VALUE)
    public ResponseEntity<User> searchUsers() { /* ... */ }
}
```

Allowed:
```java
@RequestMapping("/api/rest/user")
class UserController {

    /* ... /api/rest/user handlers */

    @GetMapping("/user/{id}", produces = MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_VALUE)
    public ResponseEntity<UserDTO> searchUsers() { /* ... */ }
}
```

### (API 4) Front-end API usage

If the module you want to use has a CRUD interface, the `$ressource` function
must be used to create a front-end service as it creates default functions for
a CRUD API usage given a base route. Otherwise create your service using the
`$http` angular service. See
[\$resource][ngdoc_resource] and
[\$http][ngdoc_http].

Any additional routes to a CRUD endpoint can be added to the `$ressource` call. 

A few examples where `/<object>` also has a CRUD api:
| method | url                    | meaning                      |
| ------ | ---------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| GET    | `/<object>/search?...` | a search with filters        |
| POST   | `/<object>/task`       | perform a task on the object |
